# Underwriting Risk Insight Pipeline

## Objective
Build a serverless pipeline that ingests, processes, and visualizes two open datasets to generate underwriting risk insights for **automobiles** line of business.

## Datasets Used
- Traffic Accident Casualties (ingested via API to BigQuery)  
- Rainfall Averages (ingested via API to BigQuery)  

## Architecture Overview
API → Ingestion (Python) → BigQuery → Risk Score Computation → Visualization (Matplotlib)
